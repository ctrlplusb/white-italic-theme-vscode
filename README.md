Minimalist monochrome theme for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) with support for italic fonts (e.g. Operator Mono).

## Benefits

### Less UI, more code

It lets you focus on the beauty of your code by fading all visual distractions around.
Perfect when you know your editor and its shortcuts.

### Meaningful syntax

All programming languages already have punctuation and style: we type characters, not rainbows.
After some weeks away from noisy and inconsistent colorization, you'll start to have a better global view over your projects and switching between languages will be more natural.

### Knight & Day

After sunset, the Night version saves you from eye strain and improves the quality of your sleep.
The [NightSwitch](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gharveymn.nightswitch) ([Lite](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gharveymn.nightswitch-lite)) extension can do the switch for you, every day on time.
